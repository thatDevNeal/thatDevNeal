- 👋 Hi, I’m @thatDevNeal
- 👀 I’m interested in GoLang, Financial Services, and overall full-stack development (i've been doing more backend work lately)!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning lots of development things! Always freshening up on my AWS, but I've been really into trying to get better at GoLang. At one point I was totally a NodeJS type of guy, even Java, but now Go seems to be hot!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on many open framework things! I do some development on my freetime as well, wherever i'm needed i'm always glad to help!
- 📫 How to reach me...shoot me a good message and lets see where we can go from there
